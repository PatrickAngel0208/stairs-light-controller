# Stairs light controller

This is a PCB that controls the start and stop of lights, in this case, for a specific proposal, stairs lights. This has two inputs for ultrasonic sensors, which will detect the presence of a person, and has nine solid-state outputs. All this stuff is controlled by an Arduino nano.
